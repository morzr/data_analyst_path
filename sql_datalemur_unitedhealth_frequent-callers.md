**Question ([link](https://datalemur.com/questions/frequent-callers))**

UnitedHealth has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs â€“ whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.
Write a query to find how many UHG members made 3 or more calls. `case_id` column uniquely identifies each call made.

### `callers` Table:

| **Column Name** | **Type** |
| ----------- | ---- |
| policy\_holder\_id | integer |
| case\_id | varchar |
| call\_category | varchar |
| call\_received | timestamp |
| call\_duration\_secs | integer |

### `callers` Example Input:

| **policy\_holder\_id** | **case\_id** | **call\_category** | **call\_received** | **call\_duration\_secs** | **original\_order** |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 50837000 | dc63-acae-4f39-bb04 | claims | 03/09/2022 02:51:00 | 205 | 130 |

### Example Output:

| **member\_count** |
| ------------ |
| 1 |

### Explanation:

The only caller who made 3 or more calls is member ID 50837000.

**My Solution**:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(policy_holder_id) as member_count
FROM (
  SELECT policy_holder_id	, COUNT(case_id) AS num_calls FROM callers
  GROUP BY policy_holder_id 
  HAVING COUNT(case_id) >= 3 
  ) AS call_records 
```

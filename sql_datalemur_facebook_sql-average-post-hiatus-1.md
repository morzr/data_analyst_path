### `posts` Table:

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| user\_id | integer |
| post\_id | integer |
| post\_date | timestamp |
| post\_content | text |

### `posts` Example Input:

| user\_id | post\_id | post\_date | post\_content |
| ------- | ------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 151652 | 599415 | 07/10/2021 12:00:00 | Need a hug |
| 661093 | 624356 | 07/29/2021 13:00:00 | Bed. Class 8-12. Work 12-3. Gym 3-5 or 6. Then class 6-10. Another day that's gonna fly by. I miss my girlfriend |
| 004239 | 784254 | 07/04/2021 11:00:00 | Happy 4th of July! |
| 661093 | 442560 | 07/08/2021 14:00:00 | Just going to cry myself to sleep after watching Marley and Me. |
| 151652 | 111766 | 07/12/2021 19:00:00 | I'm so done with covid - need travelling ASAP! |

### Example Output:

| user\_id | days\_between |
| ------- | ------------ |
| 151652 | 2 |
| 661093 | 21 |

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!

**My Solution**:

```sql
SELECT user_id, MAX(post_date::Date) - MIN(post_date::Date)AS days_between FROM posts
WHERE date_part('year', post_date::DATE) = 2021
 GROUP BY user_id
 HAVING COUNT(post_id) > 1;
```

# My Data Analyst Path

In this repository I've documented my journey to become a data analyst - the courses and written material I've used along the way to acquire the required knowledge problems, and the problems I've solved for practice.

Each file in this repository contains one questio, with a link to the original question and my solution, as accepted by the platform:

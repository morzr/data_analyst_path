**Question ([link](https://datalemur.com/questions/cards-issued-difference))**

Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card, and to gain some context, you are analyzing how many credit cards were issued each month.
Write a query that outputs the name of each credit card and the difference in issued amount between the month with the most cards issued, and the least cards issued. Order the results according to the biggest difference.

### `monthly_cards_issued` Table:

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| issue\_month | integer |
| issue\_year | integer |
| card\_name | string |
| issued\_amount | integer |

### `monthly_cards_issued` Example Input:

| card\_name | issued\_amount | issue\_month | issue\_year |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Chase Freedom Flex | 55000 | 1 | 2021 |
| Chase Freedom Flex | 60000 | 2 | 2021 |
| Chase Freedom Flex | 65000 | 3 | 2021 |
| Chase Freedom Flex | 70000 | 4 | 2021 |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 170000 | 1 | 2021 |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 175000 | 2 | 2021 |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 180000 | 3 | 2021 |

### Example Output:

| card\_name | difference |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Chase Freedom Flex | 15000 |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 10000 |

### Explanation

Chase Freedom Flex's best month was 70k cards issued and the worst month was 55k cards, so the difference is 15k cards.
Chase Sapphire Reserveâ€™s best month was 180k cards issued and the worst month was 170k cards, so the difference is 10k cards.

**My Solution**:

```sql
SELECT card_name, MAX(issued_amount) - MIN(issued_amount)  AS difference FROM monthly_cards_issued
GROUP BY card_name
ORDER BY difference DESC;
```

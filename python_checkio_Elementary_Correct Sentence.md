**Question ([link](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/correct-sentence/))**

For the input of your function, you will be given one sentence. You have to return a corrected version, that starts with a capital letter and ends with a period (dot).

Pay attention to the fact that not all of the fixes are necessary. If a sentence already ends with a period (dot), then adding another one will be a mistake.

Input: A string.

Output: A string.

Example:

```python
assert correct_sentence("greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
assert correct_sentence("Greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
assert correct_sentence("Greetings, friends.") == "Greetings, friends."
assert correct_sentence("greetings, friends.") == "Greetings, friends."
```


**My Solution**

```python
def most_frequent(data: list[str]) -> str:
     return max(data, key=data.count)

print("Example:")
print(most_frequent(["a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "a"]))

assert most_frequent(["a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "a"]) == "a"
assert most_frequent(["a", "a", "bi", "bi", "bi"]) == "bi"

print("The mission is done! Click 'Check Solution' to earn rewards!")
```

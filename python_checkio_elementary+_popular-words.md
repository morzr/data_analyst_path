**Question ([link](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/popular-words/))**

In this mission your task is to determine the popularity of certain words in the text.

At the input of your function are given 2 arguments: the text and the array of words the popularity of which you need to determine.

When solving this task pay attention to the following points:

The words should be sought in all registers. This means that if you need to find a word "one" then words like "one", "One", "oNe", "ONE" etc. will do.
The search words are always indicated in the lowercase.
If the word wasnâ€™t found even once, it has to be returned in the dictionary with 0 (zero) value.
Input: The text and the search words array.

Output: The dictionary where the search words are the keys and values are the number of times when those words are occurring in a given text.

Example:

```python
assert popular_words(
    "\nWhen I was One\nI had just begun\nWhen I was Two\nI was nearly new\n",
    ["i", "was", "three", "near"],
) == {"i": 4, "was": 3, "three": 0, "near": 0}
```


**My Solution**

```python
def popular_words(text: str, words: list) -> dict:
    words_in_text = text.lower().split()
    occurences = dict.fromkeys(words, 0)
    
    for x in words_in_text:
        if x in words:
            occurences[x] += 1

    return occurences
    

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Example:")
    print(popular_words('''
When I was One
I had just begun
When I was Two
I was nearly new
''', ['i', 'was', 'three', 'near']))

    # These "asserts" are used for self-checking and not for an auto-testing
    assert popular_words('''
When I was One
I had just begun
When I was Two
I was nearly new
''', ['i', 'was', 'three', 'near']) == {
        'i': 4,
        'was': 3,
        'three': 0,
        'near': 0
    }
    print("Coding complete? Click 'Check' to earn cool rewards!")
